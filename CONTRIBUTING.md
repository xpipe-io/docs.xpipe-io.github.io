## Wanna help make the doc site better?

Make a doc page that reference the issue at hand in a general term, to apply to every e.g terminal or function in XPipe. If a doc page is already there, you can change the page to fit with the included issue.

Use `https://mdxjs.com/playground/` to play around with the style of the page if you don't have a preview in your IDE. <br/>
Docusaurus uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), normal markdown also works fine. 

Be sure to follow a breakdown structure:

```
docs
|
-- cli
   |
   -- man
|
-- synchronization
```
