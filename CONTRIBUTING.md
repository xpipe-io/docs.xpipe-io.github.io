## Wanna help make the doc site better?

Any contribution is welcome! There are no real formal contribution guidelines right now, they will maybe come later.

Use `https://mdxjs.com/playground/` to play around with the style of the page if you don't have a preview in your IDE. <br/>
Docusaurus uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), normal markdown also works fine. 

Be sure to follow a breakdown structure:

```
docs
|
-- cli
   |
   -- man
|
-- synchronization
```
