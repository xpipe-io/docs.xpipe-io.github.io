### vs DBeaver

DBeaver is a very useful open source database tool. 
X-Pipe and DBeaver share some overlap in regard to the connection manager, at least for databases.
However, that is where to similarities end.
DBeaver focuses heavy on more complex data workflows that are realized through more complex queries.


### vs Termius

Termius shares some similarities with the X-Pipe connection explorer.
However, it focuses exclusively on SSH connections and does not support other types of connections.
It also does not support opening your connection in an arbitrary terminal,
only the built-in Termius terminal is supported.
Furthermore, Termius stores all connection information in the cloud and not purely on your end.

There are also the following points:
- Does not come with free version for unlimited time
- Is not open source
- Requires a user account
