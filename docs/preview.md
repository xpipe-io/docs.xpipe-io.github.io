# XPipe Pro Preview

The feature you are trying to use is available in the pro preview, which allows anyone who is interested to try it out newly released professional-only features for two weeks after their release.

## Motivation

This pro preview enables me to test new features and the license management with a lot more people than would otherwise be possible with only the professional license users. It also allows you to experiment, share feedback, and get a glimpse of all the new features without having to order anything.

## Verification

Once you enter a key, the application will communicate with the license server on every startup to verify that everything is in order. From there, it also fetches the current information of which features are currently new and are still included in the preview. Therefore, you can't just modify your local system time to circumvent the time restriction.
