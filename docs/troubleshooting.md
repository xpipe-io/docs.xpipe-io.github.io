# Troubleshooting

In case of any problems, you can do the following:

- Use the automatic report functionality of the error reporter if it comes up
- You can also open the issue reporter manually in the menu bar
- Alternatively, you can also open an issue on GitHub and describe the error in more detail
- Join the [XPipe Discord Server](https://discord.gg/8y89vS8cRb), the [XPipe Slack Server](https://join.slack.com/t/XPipe/shared_invite/zt-1awjq0t5j-5i4UjNJfNe1VN4b_auu6Cg), or email [hello@xpipe.io](mailto://hello@xpipe.io) to talk with the developers
- There is a special debug mode for more verbose output available that you can start in the settings menu
- If the application does not even start, or you want to dig deeper into the error cause, you can find the different log files at `<User Home>\.xpipe\logs` or `~/.xpipe/logs`.
