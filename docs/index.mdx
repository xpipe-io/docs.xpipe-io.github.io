# Installation

There are two different ways of installing XPipe:

* [Installers](#installers)
* [Portable](#portable-installation)

You are able to essentially get the same feature set regardless which way you choose.
There are a few small exceptions, such as desktop environment integrations for your
operating system that are only available with installers, however these features are not crucial to XPipe.

The possible reasons why you would want to look out for a certain way of installing XPipe are:

* intended usage
* possible system permission issues
* personal preferences

## Installers

Installers are the easiest way to get started with XPipe.
Prebuilt installers for every operating system can be found here:

#### [XPipe Releases on GitHub](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest)

The installers handle all the setup and XPipe will work right out of the box.
By using the installer distribution, you can also make use of the autoupdate functionality,
which you can of course also disable if wanted.

## Portable Installation

Alternatively, you can also make use of the portable XPipe distributions.
These are just archives that you can unpack anywhere you like without having to run an installer.

In contrast to the installers, a manual portable installation requires some extra work and also lacks several features
such as shortcuts, other desktop environment integrations, and automatic environment variable setup.
There is also no autoupdate functionality included in the portable distribution,
which means that you have to manually download new releases if you want to use them.

You can find the latest portable releases at the same location as the installers:
#### [XPipe Releases on GitHub](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest)

### Environment Variables

In order to get the most out of XPipe, it is strongly recommended to set the available environment variables.
The installer takes care of that automatically for you.
There are however several additional steps required to properly use a portable XPipe installation.

First, the ``XPIPE_HOME`` environment variable has to be set so that it points the your portable location.
If this variable is not set, the CLI and APIs will not be able to start and interact with XPipe.
Furthermore, if you want to use the ``xpipe`` CLI executable from the command-line, its directory
has to be added to your ``PATH`` variable as well.
You can do this as follows:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>

You can use the [setx](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/setx) command as follows:

```
setx XPIPE_HOME "<xpipe location>"
setx PATH "%XPIPE_HOME%\cli\bin;%PATH%"
```

Alternatively, you can also use the graphical user interface
in the Windows control panel to set environment variables.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

Add the following commands to your respective dotfiles on your system:

```
export XPIPE_HOME=<xpipe location>
export PATH=$XPIPE_HOME/cli/bin:$PATH
```

Don't forget to reload your configuration with `source <dotfile>`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">

Add the following commands to your respective dotfiles on your system:

```
export XPIPE_HOME=<xpipe location>
export PATH=$XPIPE_HOME/Contents/MacOS/:$PATH
```

In most cases, the installation location used above would be `/Applications/XPipe.app`.
Also don't forget to reload your configuration with `source <dotfile>`.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Manpages

To be able to access the man pages of the XPipe CLI with `man <xpipe command>`,
you also have to register the manpage files as follows:
<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```
cp "$XPIPE_HOME/cli/man/*" /usr/share/man/man1/
mandb
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">

```
cp "$XPIPE_HOME/Resources/cli/man/*" /usr/share/man/man1/
mandb
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Bash Autocompletion

To be able to use the tab completion for the XPipe CLI commands, you have to do as follows:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```
ln -s "$XPIPE_HOME/cli/xpipe_completion" /etc/bash_completion.d/xpipe
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">

```
ln -s "$XPIPE_HOME/Resources/cli/xpipe_completion" /etc/bash_completion.d/xpipe
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You need to restart your shell to make use of the tap completion afterwards.
