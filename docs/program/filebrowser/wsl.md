# XPipe WSL File browser
XPipe does **NOT** support UCN file paths via the file browser. So if you are trying to use files on your local ubuntu WSL, to connect to a server. Then it is recommened to copy the file into your own PC's `.ssh` folder.

Use of WSL files are supported via the Powershell, **NOT** CMD.
