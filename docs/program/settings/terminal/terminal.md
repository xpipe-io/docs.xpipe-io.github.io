# XPipe Terminal Configuration
This is the settings for what terminal you wanna use with XPipe. <br/>
(It is recommened to use the default terminal emulator)

### Terminal emulator
You can choose what terminal emulator you wanna use here.

In the dropdown menu you can see status icons on what terminal emulators you have on the system, and what terminal emulators will work with XPipe.

The `Test` is to "test" if the terminal emulator is working correctly with XPipe. 

## MacOS Terminal Issues 

Please test the terminal via `XPipe -> Settings -> Terminal -> Press "Test"`.

**Common MacOS Permission issue:**
Check your privacy settings, specifically “Full Disk Access.” Add e.g Kitty/XPipe if it’s not already in there. If it’s already there try removing it and re-adding it. Sometimes it helps closing the terminal via the dock and reopen it. 

Alternatively you can re-install the terminal.
