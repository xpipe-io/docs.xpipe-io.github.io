## XPipe Vault
The vault is the data storage that XPipe uses to function correctly.

### Encrypt all vault data
You can encrypt this storage with the `Encrypt all vault data ` option, this add's another layer of protection. The protection is added to usernames and hostnames, etc, that is not encrypted by default.

**Be aware that your git history/diffs will become useless if you encrypt it**

### Master Passphrase
You can enter a `Master Passphrase` to increse the data security. It provides an additionel layer of encryption to your sensitive information.
