# XPipe App
Welcome to the documentation for the interface and settings.

In the pages on the left sidebar,
you will find information to navigate the program better and understand the functions that you can use.

Most of the interface you see in the documentation is the professional version of XPipe.
It won't affect the use of XPipe if you are on the community edition.
If a feature is "professionel," it will be indicated with a `PRO`
