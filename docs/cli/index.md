# XPipe CLI

The command-line interface of XPipe is a fundamental part of the XPipe project.
It gives you the ability to easily access all XPipe features on all operating systems.

## Setup

In case you used an installer to set up XPipe on your system,
all environment variable related setup to access the CLI executable from the command-line should already be done.
You can easily verify this by typing ``xpipe --help`` in a terminal.

In case the ``xpipe`` command can not be found or you are using a portable distribution, you can
look up the [environment variables](../installation#environment-variables)
section in the installation manual to add the XPipe CLI to your path variable.

## Getting Started

There are several ways to familiarize yourself with the command-line interface.
For a full reference, you can consult:

* The command ``xpipe --help`` for a general overview and
  ``xpipe help <subcommand>`` for detailed information about a certain subcommand.
* Manpages, which you can access with ``man xpipe`` on Linux and macOS systems
  when they are installed using the installer distribution
* The online CLI manpages, which can be found [here](man/xpipe)
