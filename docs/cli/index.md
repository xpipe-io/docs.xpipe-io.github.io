# X-Pipe CLI

The command-line interface of X-Pipe is a fundamental part of the X-Pipe project.
It gives you the ability to easily access all X-Pipe features on all operating systems.

## Setup

In case you used an installer to setup X-Pipe on your system,
all environment variable related setup to access the CLI executable from the command-line should already be done.
You can easily verify this by typing ``xpipe --help`` in a terminal.

In case the ``xpipe`` command can not be found or you are using a portable distribution, you can
look up the :ref:`variables` section in the installation manual to add the X-Pipe CLI to your path variable.

## Getting Started

There are several ways to familiarize yourself with the command-line interface.
This page will only give you an introduction.
For a full reference, you can consult:

* The command ``xpipe help`` for a general overview and
  ``xpipe help <subcommand>`` for detailed information about a certain subcommand.
* Manpages, which you can access with ``man xpipe`` on Linux and MacOS systems
  when they are installed using the installer distribution
* The online CLI manpages, which can be found `here <man/index.html>`_
